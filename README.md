# Whatsapp4Windows
Whatsapp client for Windows written in C# (WIP)

!! CODE IS NOT READY TO BE USED BY USERS || DEVELOPER / EXPERIANCED USERS ONLY !!

I should write a README here:

To get it working add AddContact()'s on the loading code. (Form_Load), groups are auto sync'd only contacts are not
You need to enter your phone number like 3112345678 in the textbox, do not use a +! Also enter a name how others see you when you're not in their contacts and your login key


*Use a Search engine of choice to find how to get your whatsapp key or try to use the get key interface (its kinda working).
